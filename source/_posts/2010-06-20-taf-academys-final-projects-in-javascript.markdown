Alex Tokar, Yonas Seifu and Brian Gershon went down to check out the final projects atÂ [Technology Access Foundation's Academy class in Federal Way](http://schools.fwps.org/taf/).

This was the first class there to teach JavaScript, taught by Seth Nelson and Susan Evans.

We saw Tic-Tac-Toe, a yo-yo animation, a Magic Eight Ball game, "guess that image", and even a slot machine.

The students did a fine job, and it was impressive to see what 10th grade students were able to learn and accomplish in a limited amount of time.

In one fell swoop, Eric Magnuson's interview in SIJ's [Five under 35](http://www.sustainableindustries.com/sijnews/9482077.html) article highlights the recent formation of our company Web Collective Inc -- as well as connections around worker-owned cooperatives, Seattle's Business Alliance for Local Living Economics (BALLE) chapter, and the Sustainable MBA Program at Bainbridge Graduate Institute.

Many of us in Web Collective met through our connection with BALLE Seattle and our work around creating thriving local economies.  Prior to that I ran across the newly forming national BALLE organization while completing graduate work through the [Center for Creative Change](http://www.antiochsea.edu/about/creativechange/) at Antioch University Seattle in 2001.  Around that time I also stumbled on the world of open source and Zope (and soon Plone) - which quickly became the [core of my business](http://www.evolvingbits.com/about/). A lot can happen in 5 years!

There was a nice turnout of around 40 people at the SURF Incubator on Wednesday Jan 13th.

There were really three events being held at the same time:



	
  * SURF Open House

	
  * SURF iPhone Coding Night Meetup

	
  * and a last minute merge of the "iPhone App Developers" Meetup


The merging of events ultimately created a room full of interesting and engaged people who were networking and discussing mobile app development.

I would say that most were there to network, and some were there to play with code.

The networkers were a nice mix of entrepreneurs and people looking for iPhone developers. The coders were mainly new developers (and some graphic designers) that were getting into iPhone or Android development. The coding part of the session ended up very light because the event took on more of a networking feel.

The Open House event was an active Q&A session for those interested in the incubator, upcoming plans, and how to get involved.

I personally made some new connections, reconnected with other iPhone developers and designers, and met people who I hadn't run across yet at other iPhone events.  The feeling was that there was pent up demand for iPhone networking and coding.


## More about SURF Incubator


The SURF space is available as a location for people to collaborate and work on code together -- open every weekday during January.  The space is also available for other iPhone / Android events.  There are desks for people to pair up or meet in groups as well. The plan is to ultimately host many events and activities, and there is also permanent space for developers and those building businesses. This month is the Open House so people can start to explore and use the space.  [http://surfincubator.com](http://surfincubator.com)

The recent events have been geared toward iPhone, but the SURF Incubator will also host Android events. This would open up opportunities to create synergies between the two platforms.

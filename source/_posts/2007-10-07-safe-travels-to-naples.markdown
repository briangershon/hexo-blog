I wanted to wish Plonistas a safe journey to Naples for what will be another fantastic Plone conference!

Back in Seattle, we're looking forward to hearing post-conference highlights at our upcoming [Halloween Plone Meeting](http://www.seattleplone.org/Members/briang/october2007-plone-gathering).

I'm particularly excited for five Seattle-area Plonistas (that I know of) who are presenting this year. After seeing previews of two of these presentations in September, I know conference attendees are in for a treat:



	
  * Andrew Burkhalter, Jon Stahl, and Veda Williams from ONENW are presenting on [a nice range of topics](http://blogs.onenw.org/jon/archives/2007/10/04/see-you-at-plone-conference-2007/) spanning from those new to Plone 3 all the way through advanced Plone skinning, development and integration.

	
  * Jonathan Callahan will be presenting _Plone for Government Science -- How to get buy in from managers, security watchdogs and colleagues_.

	
  * Paul Bugni will be presenting _Where's the source, Luke? : How to find and debug the code behind Plone_.

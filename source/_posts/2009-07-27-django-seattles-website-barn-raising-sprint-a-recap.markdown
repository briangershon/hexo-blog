## New Django Seattle Website


Thanks to 14 Sprinters who came together on July 25, we now have a Django Seattle Website at [http://www.djangoseattle.org](http://www.djangoseattle.org)

![Some of our Django Seattle Sprinters](/images/post/2009/07/django-seattle-sprint-group.jpg)

There was a lot of infrastructure work done at the sprint which is still in development and didn't make it to the live site yet -- but the experience of getting to know each other, and learning/sharing Django knowledge was another fine Sprint accomplishment.

Here's a brief summary of what people worked on:



	
  * Integrated in Blogging, Profile and Calendar functionality from [django-basic-apps](http://code.google.com/p/django-basic-apps/). _Initially Pinax was explored, but had a lot of dependencies and seemed better for creating specific sites genres, but was challenging to incorporate into our existing site._

	
  * Created a Twitter portlet that shows live #djangoseattle Tweets.

	
  * Setup Flatpages for core content, and creating a database-driven menu

	
  * Created a logo and initial site design and templates

	
  * Setup Django on live server

	
  * Used the Django Debug Toolbar while developing the site

	
  * Some were playing with Django for the first time

	
  * Some floated around to help diagnose problems and help those new to Django

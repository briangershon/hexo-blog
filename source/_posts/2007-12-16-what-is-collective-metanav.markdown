To help illustrate MetaNav, I've created two  screencasts:



	
  * [MetaNav Overview screencast ](http://www.archive.org/details/CollectiveMetanavOverview) (direct link to [full-size version](http://www.archive.org/download/CollectiveMetanavOverview/metanav-overview.mov))

	
  * [Plone Walk-through of MetaNav screencast](http://www.archive.org/details/CollectiveMetanavWalkthru) (direct link to [full-size version](http://www.archive.org/download/CollectiveMetanavWalkthru/metanav-walkthru.mov))


Briefly, this product allows Plone administrators and content-editors to build and maintain an alternate navigation  hierarchy for their site, such as in audience-based and topic-based navigation schemes.

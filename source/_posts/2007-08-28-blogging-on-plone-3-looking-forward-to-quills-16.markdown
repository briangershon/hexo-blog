Quills definitely seems the way to go for blogging in Plone 3 - it's nicely engineered in a Zope 3 style and much work has gone into it recently during the Quills development via Google Summer of Code.

I had planned to create this blog using the latest Quills 1.6 trunk to learn both about blogging and "blogging on Plone" -- so downloaded and gave it a try.  It installed ok on Plone 3, but I ran into errors posting blogs and playing with the portlets -- to be expected during early beta testing.

I'm also intrigued with [QuillsEnabled](https://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/QuillsEnabled)  (currently in alpha) - which leverages the Quills family of products, but takes the approach of adding blog functionality to ordinary Plone content.  _This pattern is also used in [Plone getpaid](http://www.plonegetpaid.com/) to allow ordinary Plone content to be marked Payable so that it then takes on additional functionality such as a price and a way to add the item to your shopping cart._

I'm looking forward to [following the progress of Quills](http://quills.sitefusion.co.uk/blog/) (nice work Tim Hicks!), and as things become more stable I envision my next blog projects using Quills.

In the meantime, I look forward to learning more about blogging and blogging software through Wordpress, which is an impressive and fun blogging solution.

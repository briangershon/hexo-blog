Brian Gershon headed down to White Center to see the final event of the season for TAF's [TechStart](http://techaccess.org/TechStart/techstart.html) program.

"TechStart is TAF's free, yearlong after-school program for students in kindergarten through 8th grade. The focus of TechStart is providing science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) enrichment to underserved children of color through project-based learning and advanced technology tools."

There were three event themes in Robotics (using Lego Mindstorms), including:



	
  * The Hand Crank Race where students had to build a robot, and power it by crank, and get to the finish line.

	
  * The Wind Turbine Event, where students had studied alternative wind energy and created a turbine connected to a robot. The robot would calculate the speed to determine which turbines had the best design.

	
  * And the Archery Event, where students are given the distance to the archery target when they show up to the event, and then they need to program their robots to try to stop perfectly on the center of the bullseye.

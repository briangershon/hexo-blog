### Scale and Performance - Being Awesome


After [Web Collective](http://www.webcollective.coop/) just finished a Django website that needed to scale to 12,000 simultaneous peak users, Flickr architect [Cal Henderson's keynote](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Fr65PFqfk) was timely and very entertaining - particularly his commentary on "serious" frameworks and essentially a comic roasting of all of the major ones.

Since most of us are building "houses and not skyscrapers" there is some question as to whether Django should introduce all of Cal's suggestions (_who is a "scale" geek working with on a very large website_), but how can you argue with his three major focus areas of scale, performance and **"being awesome**".

Discussions of "scale" and "Django" remind me to play with Google App Engine soon. I also just discovered [Django Debug Toolbar](http://swik.net/django/Django+Community+Aggregator/Rob+Hudson:+Introducing+the+Django+Debug+Toolbar/cfbmq) and other interesting things reading through Cal's [blog](http://www.iamcal.com/).


### Learning from other Python Frameworks (Django and Zope)


With Zope (and Plone) being the platform I've used for some time now, I found [Mark Ramm's perspective](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fipFKyW2FA4) on how to learn from all the smart folks in various Python (and other) frameworks a good 10,000 ft reminder.

He highlights that Zope3, Turbogears, and Pylons have learned some of the lessons of old Zope2 in that they are frameworks that strive to use community components that work with each other in multiple contexts.  They also are trying not to isolate themselves from the Python web community by building functionality specific to just one platform.

He wasn't saying Django was far afloat in these areas, but rather that Django could make some of its innovations available more easily to other frameworks (e.g. Django's ORM, and Django's template engine), and that it should maybe use some of the Python components from other frameworks (e.g. Django middleware and WSGI middleware compatibility).

I look forward to poking around the rest of the DjangoCon 2008 videos, such as [Guido van Rossum's keynote](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmyFcChTc4M) and others on [YouTube's DjangoCon 2008 Session's playlist](http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=D415FAF806EC47A1).

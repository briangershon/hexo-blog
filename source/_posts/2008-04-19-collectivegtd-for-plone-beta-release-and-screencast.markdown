I've just released the beta of CollectiveGTD, and have included a screencast to provide an overview of current functionality.

This beta release of CollectiveGTD for Plone 3.0 includes new features such as:



	
  * AJAX Inline Editing using KSS

	
  * Filtering of Actions by Context tag and Project tag

	
  * An Import script that will import an iGTD CSV export and which is easy to modify for importing other formats.


The 8-minute screencast is available here: [CollectiveGTD Beta 1 Screencast](/images/post/2008/04/collectivegtd_demo1.mov)

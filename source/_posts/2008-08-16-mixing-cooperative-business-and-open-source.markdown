Cooperative Businesses are relatively new in the consulting and services field, as compared with more well known producer coops.

We've spent the last two years forming and running a Cooperative Business, and hope others consider doing the same.

The combination of organizing as a Cooperative, being part of Plone and other Open Source software communities, and partnering with clients who share our values, have led to a strong year of collaboration and growth.

Here is a [brief list of incentives and highlights](http://www.webcollective.coop/Members/briang/why-a-cooperative-business) for others thinking about alternative business models that may include Cooperatives and Open Source software.[](http://www.webcollective.coop)

[Web Collective, Inc](http://www.webcollective.coop) recently celebrated its one-year anniversary as a Washington State Cooperative Business.

These days we're using a variety of version control systems and switching between them regularly.

My most used command is checking my working directory status, so I've distilled it down to a one-letter shortcut that determines which type of repository I'm in, then does an appropriate status for that system.

I just setup an alias like this:

    s='~/s/s.sh'

So just type `s` and don't worry about which version control you're in.

    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>Here are several options for setting up JavaScript unit testing for code built with the Google Closure Library, albeit these options are helpful for testing a wide variety of JavaScript projects.</p>
<p>Google Closure Library is self-described as a &quot;broad, well-tested, modular, and cross-browser JavaScript library.&quot;</p>
<p>We&#39;re using the <a href="http://www.limejs.com" target="_blank">LimeJS</a> HTML5 game framework, which is built on this library.</p>
<h2 id="our-contestants">Our Contestants</h2>
<h3 id="1-headless-testing-with-jasmine-1-2">1. Headless testing with Jasmine 1.2</h3>
<p>Jasmine works well. There are two approaches you can use: an HTML runner with jasmine.js, or the Ruby-based runner. Originally we were hoping to take the same approach as the Ruby-runner (with all batteries included, including easy headless testing) but using Mocha and Node.js instead to be on a full JavaScript stack.  Though we ended up having to go to an HTML runner + mocha.js to get the DOM testing to work, in scenario 3 below.</p>
<p><em>In hindsight, by ending up with the HTML + JS approach in scenario 3, Jasmine and Mocha + PhantomJS are very similar approaches.</em></p>
<h3 id="2-mocha-testing-on-node-js">2. Mocha testing on Node.js</h3>
<p>Mocha testing on Node.js works well (easy setup, no html test runner required), but I wasn&#39;t able to get headless DOM working. If your tests don&#39;t require DOM, this is a good way to go. <em>One issue: It takes more effort to debug tests with breakpoints because the code is running on node.js. In the other scenarios, you can just add a <code>debugger</code> line and debug the tests in the browser.</em></p>
<h3 id="3-headless-testing-with-mocha-and-phantomjs">3. Headless testing with Mocha and PhantomJS</h3>
<p><strong>Our winner</strong>: Headless testing with Mocha and PhantomJS via <a href="https://github.com/metaskills/mocha-phantomjs" target="_blank">mocha-phantomjs</a> allows us to use JavaScript tooling, headless DOM testing and a nice Jasmine BDD style for writing tests.</p>
<h3 id="4-testing-with-the-google-closure-library-testing-framework">4. Testing with the Google Closure Library testing framework</h3>
<p>You can use the Google Closure Library testing framework, which is more of a traditional JUnit style framework and not a BDD-style framework like Jasmine or Mocha. Please check out the Closure documentation for more info.</p>
<h2 id="let-s-get-testing">Let&#39;s Get Testing</h2>
<p>Here&#39;s how each can be setup.</p>
<p>Assume you keep your tests in a <code>my-project/spec</code> folder and your code is under a peer <code>my-project/scripts</code> folder. Assume all test-related files discussed below are in the <code>./spec</code> folder and that tests are kicked off via a script in that folder.</p>
<h3 id="1-jasmine">1. Jasmine</h3>
<p>This is a personal favorite. It has all batteries included and doesn&#39;t need a separate HTML runner for DOM testing if using the Ruby Gem. We liked this approach, and tried to do it with Mocha + node.js (to get the same features as the Ruby Gem, but on a JavaScript stack) though ultimately went with Scenario 3 below.</p>
<p>For general setup of headless Jasmine testing, see my <a href="https://github.com/briangershon/headless-jasmine-boilerplate" target="_blank">jasmine-headless-boilerplate</a> repository.</p>
<p>Once setup, to tailor for Google Closure Library, in <code>javascripts/support/jasmine.yml</code> (setup by default with <code>jasmine init</code>) add your project&#39;s base.js and generated deps.js file to <code>./spec</code>.</p>
<pre><code>src_files:
    - scripts/libs/closure/closure/goog/base.js
    - scripts/deps.js
</code></pre><p>You can then just create a standard Jasmine test file with goog.require() statements at the top to bring in the module dependencies:</p>
<pre><code>goog.require(&#39;the.module.I.am.testing&#39;);
goog.require(&#39;a.dependency&#39;);

describe(&quot;the.module.I.am.testing&quot;, function () {

});
</code></pre><h3 id="2-mocha-testing-on-node-js">2. Mocha Testing on Node.js</h3>
<p>After setting up node.js and npm, you can create a package.json file to make it easy to setup all the dependencies by just running <code>npm install</code> in your <code>./spec</code> folder.</p>
<p>If you have a script that kicks off the tests, you can optionally add that to the &quot;scripts &gt; tests&quot; key like seen below so that you can just run <code>npm test</code>.</p>
<p>Also, you&#39;ll need to use the <a href="https://github.com/gatapia/nclosure" target="_blank">nclosure</a> library to allow node.js to bring in dependencies via goog.require().</p>
<p>In <code>./spec</code> create 3 files:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>closure.json to tell nclosure library where your files are</p>
</li>
<li><p>package.json to setup all your node.js dependencies</p>
</li>
<li><p>a run script</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are examples:</p>
<p>closure.json</p>
<pre><code>{
  additionalDeps:[&#39;../scripts/deps.js&#39;],
  closureBasePath:&#39;/this/has/to/be/an/absolute/path/in/my/experience/scripts/libs/closure/&#39;
}
</code></pre><p><strong>It took some time to figure out the right file paths</strong>. Basically:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>&quot;additionalDeps&quot; should be a relative path from where you&#39;re running the script that runs the tests. If you&#39;re running tests from a <code>./spec</code> folder, and the code lives in a peer (to <code>./spec</code>) ../scripts folder, use the example above.</p>
</li>
<li><p>However the closureBasePath only worked as an absolute path, plus you leave off the trailing <code>/closure/goog</code> (since often closure is in a lib/closure/closure/goog directory structure).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I assume this could be fixed with either a patch to nclosure or maybe I wasn&#39;t doing something correctly. I also tried setting this as a parameter to the actual <code>require(&#39;nclosure&#39;).nclosure();</code> call at the top of the tests, but no difference. This would need to be solved to make it easy for a team to run tests locally.</p>
<p>package.json</p>
<pre><code>{
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;our-test-framework&quot;,
  &quot;version&quot;: &quot;0.0.0&quot;,
  &quot;description&quot;: &quot;## Unit Tests&quot;,
  &quot;main&quot;: &quot;index.js&quot;,
  &quot;scripts&quot;: {
    &quot;test&quot;: &quot;sh runtests.sh&quot;
  },
  &quot;repository&quot;: &quot;&quot;,
  &quot;author&quot;: &quot;&quot;,
  &quot;license&quot;: &quot;BSD&quot;,
  &quot;dependencies&quot;: {
      &quot;chai&quot;:&quot;~1.3&quot;,
      &quot;sinon&quot;: &quot;~1.5&quot;,
      &quot;nclosure&quot;: &quot;~0.4&quot;,
      &quot;mocha&quot;: &quot;~1.6&quot;
    }
}
</code></pre><p>runtests.sh</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/sh
./node_modules/.bin/mocha --recursive --timeout 10000 --reporter spec your/folder/to/your/specs
</code></pre><p>Here&#39;s an example test file:</p>
<pre><code>require(&#39;nclosure&#39;).nclosure();

goog.require(&#39;my.module.goes.here&#39;);
goog.require(&#39;one.of.your.dependencies&#39;);

describe(&quot;my.module.goes.here test&quot;, function () {

});
</code></pre><h3 id="3-mocha-testing-on-phantomjs-node-js-not-required-">3. Mocha Testing on PhantomJS (node.js not required)</h3>
<p>This is the current winner for our specific needs. It&#39;s mainly JavaScript based, runs headless DOM tests, and supports a nice BDD syntax.</p>
<p>This has some additional dependencies beyond the setup above:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Install PhantomJS, which on OSX is as easy as <code>brew install phantomjs</code> via Homebrew.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Bring down mocha-phantomjs.coffee and the mocha-phantomjs folder from <a href="https://github.com/metaskills/mocha-phantomjs" target="_blank">mocha-phantomjs</a> and put those in your <code>./spec</code> folder.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Bring in dependencies mocha.js and mocha.css from root of <a href="https://github.com/visionmedia/mocha" target="_blank">mocha repository</a></p>
</li>
<li><p>Bring in third-party libraries like <a href="https://github.com/LearnBoost/expect.js/" target="_blank">expect.js</a> and <a href="http://sinonjs.org" target="_blank">sinon.js</a> used by test runner HTML below. (We started with Chai&#39;s &quot;expect&quot; assertion framework, but the assertion code didn&#39;t nicely pass linting, so went with the very similar expect.js)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Instead of using the ./mocha test runner, your run-script can call each test like so:</p>
<pre><code>phantomjs mocha-phantomjs.coffee javascripts/mycontroller_spec.html
</code></pre><p>In addition to your test js file, you need an html file test runner to setup DOM for your tests.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s an example of mycontroller_spec.html:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Unit Tests&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;
    &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;../../../node_modules/mocha/mocha.css&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;div id=&quot;mocha&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;script src=&quot;../../../../scripts/libs/closure/closure/goog/base.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;script src=&quot;../../../../scripts/deps.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;script src=&quot;../../../javascripts/support/sinon-1.4.2.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;script src=&quot;../../../javascripts/support/mocha.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;script src=&quot;../../../javascripts/support/expect.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;script&gt;
      mocha.ui(&#39;bdd&#39;); 
      mocha.reporter(&#39;html&#39;);
    &lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;script src=&quot;mycontroller_spec.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;script&gt;
      if (window.mochaPhantomJS) {
        mochaPhantomJS.run();
      } else {
        mocha.run();
      }
    &lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre><p>The mycontroller_spec.js test file doesn&#39;t require any special code, just using the normal goog.require():</p>
<pre><code>goog.require(&#39;my.module.goes.here&#39;);
goog.require(&#39;one.of.your.dependencies&#39;);

describe(&quot;my.module.goes.here test&quot;, function () {

});
</code></pre><h2 id="other-thoughts-and-ideas">Other thoughts and ideas</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>For tests requiring DOM: Is it possible to substitute zombie.js instead of phantomjs?  The main reason is that then the whole stack could be in node.js and has fewer dependencies (since it wouldn&#39;t require phantomjs and mocha-phantomjs).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Selenium is another option for testing code against DOM on real browsers.</p>

    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>I&#39;d say the theme of Day Two at JSConf 2012 was <strong>inspiration</strong>, and was another great day of talks:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I think my favorite talk (best presentation, very pragmatic) was Jake Archibald&#39;s &quot;Application Cache&quot; -- why it&#39;s useful and the potholes you&#39;ll encounter while using it. You&#39;ll want to watch this video.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The best demo for me was the presentation prior, Thomas Valletta&#39;s &quot;The Web Game Console&quot;, where he talked about his experience developing his mobile game with HTML and JS. He wrote a Web Bowling game using HTML/JS on iOS as the controller, and a Node.js websocket server for displaying the bowling alley.  The source is on Github (so you can setup your own server if you want) and if multiple people play at the same time it turns into &quot;battle bowling&quot; with multiple balls at the same time.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Project Bikeshed was a great demo too. Not only did its authors put on a great daily video series, but Bikeshed allows you to do many useful things such as importing Flash SWF files, automatically turning those into JavaScript and then allowing you to show, combine, manipulate, animate any of those elements and use them in your JavaScript projects.  He demo&#39;d an iPad JavaScript game that was powered by Bikeshed.  You can also run Bikeshed on Node.js and send that to devices. With a one-line change, he showed running both scenarios.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Ok, another great demo was on Open Data in the B-Track by Daniel Beauchamp &amp; Edward Ocampo-Gooding. They actually packed about 7 small presentations into one and described their process of organizing a city hack-a-thon around Open Data and building a lot of apps for free for the benefit of your city and your community. Very inspired.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The Node.js talk from Brian Ford inspired us with some interesting readings to check out (such as the &quot;Thinking Fast and Slow&quot; book) and the importance of leveraging communities outside of JavaScript, such as the experiences of the Ruby community.  He then had many concerns about Node.js repeating concurrency mistakes that Ruby had made. <em>Though I think I mainly left there with only some good book suggestions -- it felt like it ended abruptly since there was no time for questions (since presentation went long) and no specific next steps on how to avoid said concerns.</em></p>
</li>
<li><p>One of the <strong>most inspirational</strong> talks was 19-year-old James Whelton&#39;s &quot;Changing the world one CoderDojo at a time&quot;. <a href="http://coderdojo.com/about-us/" target="_blank">CoderDojo</a> is &quot;a movement of free coding clubs for young people&quot;. Check out their site for a lot of inspiration and how to start a club yourself. Also turns out that JavaScript has been a very accessible language to use -- it requires no setup, is available everywhere, fun to work with, and can even land you a job down the road.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Jacob Thornton&#39;s &quot;Brûlons les musées&quot; talk was also very entertaining, and you&#39;ll need to see the video. He led up to the power of the JavaScript community getting together more specifically around creating specs/tests (versus primarily getting together around an implementation), which then offer flexibility and healthy competition when implementing libraries that meet those specs. His example was creating Hogan.js, which is some ways was a rewrite of Mustache.js. The improvements were possible by leveraging the Mustache tests. Then Mustache was able to make improvements. By using the specs, separate projects were able to code and optimize independently.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The final talk of the day was <a href="http://falkvinge.net/" target="_blank">Rick Falkvinge</a>&#39;s talk about politics, the Pirate Party and inspiration on how to change the world.  He told his story of how the Pirate Party has been able to make in-roads into mainstream politics, and what&#39;s possible.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="green-for-dinner">Green for Dinner</h2>
<p>After the JSConf family photo, nine of us then went to a local vegetarian restaurant called <a href="http://greenvegetarian.com/" target="_blank">Green</a> which was amazing.  The place was packed the whole time while the atmosphere was very easy going. They had a great variety of original and tasty foods.</p>
<h2 id="boot2gecko-phone">Boot2Gecko Phone</h2>
<p>In the evening, I finally had a chance to play with Mozilla&#39;s Boot2Gecko phone and built a simple app. In <a href="https://github.com/briangershon/accelo" target="_blank">Accelo</a> the JSConf logo floats around the screen and moves as you tilt the phone.</p>
<p>Development was fairly smooth and I was able to install my app as part of the Gaia update/install process, but didn&#39;t have luck yet setting it up to install as a stand-alone app.</p>
<p>Albeit since the app is solely HTML/CSS/JS it works just fine by visiting the site <a href="http://accelo.evolvingbits.com/accelo/" target="_blank"><a href="http://accelo.evolvingbits.com/accelo/">http://accelo.evolvingbits.com/accelo/</a></a> on the Boot2Gecko phone (or even works on my Macbook Pro which apparently sends accelerometer events). However when viewing on iOS, the accelerometer events seem to be reversed, so not sure which implementation is off.</p>
<h2 id="thank-you">Thank you</h2>
<p>Thanks JSConf for another great year of new friends, bull-riding, great talks, tasty food and inspiration.  I will miss the sunshine and the playtime, but excited to jump into the all new tech-wonders that I can use for my web and mobile projects back in Seattle.  The Firesky Resort in Scottsdale was a perfect conference location, and I was also very happy with my stay next door at <a href="http://www.chaparralsuites.com/" target="_blank">Chaparral Suites</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Also a big thank you to my company <a href="http://www.saltbox.com" target="_blank">Saltbox.com</a></strong> who have sponsored me to attend JSConf this year!  We&#39;re developers of an online communication and learning application that allows Sales organizations to keep a pulse on what happening with their products, their customers and their competitors.</p>

        <p>On my flight to JSConf, the Southwest Airlines magazine kicked off the topic of Play in <a href="http://spiritmag.com/features/article/its_called_play/" target="_blank">Its called Play</a></p>
<p>This theme continued throughout JSConf 2012&#39;s Day One.</p>
<p>Just a <strong>few</strong> things to play with:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Registration included getting an NFC <a href="http://www.poken.com" target="_blank">Poken</a>, taking pictures with guns and cowboy gear, and a bag of sponsor loot.</p>
</li>
<li><p>All attendees were given the first public Boot2Gecko phones from Mozilla with a <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/B2G/DeveloperPhone" target="_blank">challenge to hack it and build apps</a> by conference end.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Stephan Herhut showed us the possibilities with true parallel programming and JavaScript using <a href="https://github.com/rivertrail/rivertrail/wiki" target="_blank">Intel RiverTail</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Paul Irish showed us the latest in JavaScript tooling. His <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/39519/talks/jsconf-tools/index.html" target="_blank">presentation</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Max Shawabkeh walked us through <a href="http://repl.it/" target="_blank">repl.it</a> which runs 17 languages natively in JavaScript, including Python and Ruby. This is a great environment for new students to programming (since the only dependency is a web browser), or people wanting to play with compiler technology.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Remy Sharp talked about using JavaScript to &quot;Build Anything&quot; and gave a list of things he&#39;s like to see browsers do, such as real-time notifications, strong desktop integration, direct access to hardware, ability to local install a JavaScript app, &quot;go naked&quot; (no browser chrome visible). He also talked about things we should be using today, such as web storage instead of cookies, using HTML5 tags for web form validation (i.e. instead of a crazy client-side email regular expression, use &lt;input type=email&gt;), History API, AppCache manifest for performance (since just relying on browser cache may mean your files disappear after cache fills up), EventSource particularly for mainly server-to-client pushes (in addition to websockets), Drag and Drop.</p>
</li>
<li><p>David Nolen talked directly about the importance of Play and how ClosureScript was that playground for him. He was also inspired by the book &quot;<a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=10663" target="_blank">The Reasoned Schemer</a>&quot;.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Dan Ingalls, &quot;principal architect, designer and implementor of five generations of Smalltalk environments&quot; took us through <a href="http://www.lively-kernel.org/" target="_blank">Lively Kernel</a> which you need to see in action.  It &quot;provides a complete platform for web applications, including dynamic graphics, network access, and development tools&quot; all in the browser.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Attendees left Day One with new cowboy hats, and many rode the bull later that night at <a href="http://www.srrestaurants.com/" target="_blank">Saddle Ranch</a>.</p>

        <p>Arriving PHX was flawless, the Twilio-sponsored shuttle was there to pick me up from the airport.</p>
<p>After checking-in, it was sunny and mid-70s as a few of us awaited for a friendly volunteer-sponsored shuttle to whisk us over to <a href="http://notconf.com/" target="_blank">NotConf</a> in fine style.</p>
<p>This one day event went off without a hitch and was a lot of fun.</p>
<p>We arrived to free food, free local beer, t-shirts, sunshine, friendly faces -- and of course JavaScript.  30-min talks leap frogged 30 min demos.</p>
<h2 id="best-talk">Best talk</h2>
<p>I was only there the last half of the day, so my favorite talk was Pamela Fox&#39;s (she also won best costume) &quot;Why ternary operators make me want to kick someone in the nuts: AKA code readability.&quot; She highlighted that most JavaScript developers are users of other people (library) code, and had many good points about what to do to make users lives much easier by making the code more approachable:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Documentation -- but not too much (such as having two sets of docs that makes it unclear which are the definitive ones) and using doc generation tools to make docs part of the process and not manual</p>
</li>
<li><p>Make debugging headache free (by being clear, using less &quot;elite&quot; code, no crazy ternary operators) since at some point users will need to debug in there.  Use tools like jshint to keep your code consistent. Also, although you can write javascript without semi-colons, this is not what most users expect and can lead to pain for potential contributors and users.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Make it easy to contribute to the (library) project. A lot of dependencies for running tests could be one barrier.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="favorite-demo">Favorite Demo</h2>
<p>My favorite demo was <a href="http://deployd.com" target="_blank">deployd.com</a> who had wired up an iRobot and a maze, and attendees could create a program that navigated the robot through it, complete with leaderboard. This demonstrated their cool &quot;instant backend&quot; for software developers and tinkerers to easily create a RESTful backend with no code -- which in this case was then downloaded to a robot. Their business card says it all with &quot;Join the Backend Liberation Movement&quot;.</p>
<h2 id="thank-you">Thank you</h2>
<p>The closing event was of course outside, where we all wound down with beer, nice conversations, and a local musician who was playing for us in the courtyard. My pale Seattle skin even gained some color and was happy to absorb all that natural Vitamin D.</p>
<p>Thanks to the organizers of NotConf.com -- it was an impressive one-day conference and a great start to JSConf 2012.</p>

        <p>In the last couple of  years, JavaScript has really become hot for the next breed of web and mobile applications.</p>
<ul>
<li>JavaScript runs on a majority of mobile and desktop browsers.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>... it runs on the server.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>... it is used for developing desktop widgets and browser extensions.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>... it is being used inside desktop applications. eg scripting for <a href="http://kodapp.com/" target="_blank">Kod editor</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>... it naturally works well with the web -- easily handling JSON, HTTP and REST.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>... works well for new real-time communication techniques (eg websockets).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>... as a language it works well for asynchronous-style services.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>There&#39;s also a lot of innovation happening in the JavaScript space because it attracts both front-end and back-end developers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Over the past year I&#39;ve been working in the mobile application space primarily with native iOS and mobile-optimized websites.</p>
<p>This year I plan to expand my mobile and JavaScript skills in the following areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create applications (and web services) using server-side JavaScript with <a href="http://nodejs.org/" target="_blank">node.js</a> and learn the ecosystem that has grown up around it.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Practice new &quot;<a href="http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?933" target="_blank">mobile first</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/responsive-web-design/" target="_blank">responsive web design</a>&quot; web-development techniques where new websites are designed for mobile first, and then progressive enhanced so that the same site works well for larger screens and desktop browsers too. Mobile can no longer be thought of as a bolt-on feature, but needs to become central to web design and development efforts.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Attend <a href="http://2011.jsconf.us/" target="_blank">JSConf 2011</a> and <a href="http://nodeconf.com/" target="_blank">NodeConf 2011</a> which are both in early May in Portland, OR.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Play with more data stores.  CouchDB (for example) is a native JSON store that speaks HTTP. Mixed with client-side or server-side JavaScript (that easily works with JSON and naturally speaks HTTP) makes an interesting combination. A recent talk on <a href="http://jsconf.eu/2010/speaker/nodejs_couchdb_crazy_delicious.html" target="_blank">node.js + CouchDB</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Continue to work with the various approaches to building mobile applications to find the right tools for the job, whether native, web-based, or a mix.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Continue to practice test-driven development in JavaScript.</li>
</ul>
